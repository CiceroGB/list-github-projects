### About project

Developed on the Ignite classes to show a ,list with my github projects.

###  Technologies

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

###  Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

###  `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
